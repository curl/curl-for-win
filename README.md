# Automated, reproducible, transparent, Windows builds for [curl](https://curl.se/) and dependencies

  - Packaging aims to follow popular binary releases found on the internet.
  - Both x64 and x86 packages are built using the same process.
  - Binary packages are downloadable in `.zip` and `.tar.xz` formats.<br>
    `.xz` files and the resulting `.tar` archive can be extracted using
    [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
  - Binary packages are signed with PGP key [EXPERIMENTAL]:
    <br><https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curl/curl-for-win/main/sign-pkg-public.asc>
    <br>`002C 1689 65BA C220 2118  408B 4ED8 5DF9 BB3D 0DE8`
  - Standalone `curl.exe` and `libcurl.dll` (only
    [`msvcrt.dll`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files#MSVCRT.DLL,_MSVCP*.DLL_and_CRTDLL.DLL)
    is
    [required](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=1273)).
  - curl/libcurl are built with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)
    support enabled.
  - curl/libcurl features enabled by default (`{upcoming}`):
    <br>`dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp`
    <br>`alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli gsasl HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd`
  - The build process is fully transparent by using publicly available
    open source code, C compiler, build scripts and running the build
    [in public](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/main),
    with open, auditable [build logs](#build-logs).
  - C compiler toolchain is latest MinGW-w64 (non-multilib, x64 and x86)
    either via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on macOS),
    [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Debian)) (on Debian via Docker)
    or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
    C compiler is [LLVM/Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).
  - Binaries are cross-built and published from Linux
    (via [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/)).
    <br>Exact OS image used for the builds is
    [`debian:testing`](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/tree/dist-amd64/testing)
    (a [reproducible](https://github.com/debuerreotype/debuerreotype) image)
    via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/).
  - Binaries are built with supported
    [hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_%28computing%29)
    options enabled.
  - Binaries are using [DWARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF) in x86 and
    [SEH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft-specific_exception_handling_mechanisms#SEH)
    in x64 builds.
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes and also GPG signatures where
    available.
  - Generated binaries are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/),
    meaning they will have the same hash given the same input sources and C
    compiler.
  - Because the build environment is updated before each build, subsequent
    builds _may_ use different versions/builds of the compiler toolchain.
    This may result in different generated binaries given otherwise unchanged
    source code and configuration, sometimes thus breaking reproducibility.
    This trade-off was decided to be tolerable for more ideal binaries and
    allowing this project to automatically benefit from continuous C compiler
    updates.
  - Patching policy: No locally maintained patches. Patches are only
    applied locally if already merged upstream or &mdash; in case it is
    necessary for a successful build &mdash; had them submitted upstream with
    fair confidence of getting accepted.
  - curl/libcurl are built in MultiSSL mode, with both OpenSSL and
    [Schannel](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/com/schannel)
    available as SSL backends.
  - Optional support for [c-ares](https://c-ares.org/).
  - Generated binaries are uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
  - To verify the correct checksum for the latest build, you can look up the
    correct ones in the build log as they are generated. Watch for `main`
    branch job `Image: Ubuntu`, log lines starting with
    `SHA256(` or `SHA512(`:
      <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/main>
  - The build process is multi-platform and able to cross-build Windows
    executables from \*nix hosts (Linux and macOS tested.)
  - Packages created across different host platforms will not currently have
    identical hashes. The reason for this is the slightly different build
    options and versions of the `mingw-w64` and `binutils` tools.
  - Code signing is implemented and enabled with a self-signed certificate.
    The signature intentionally omits a trusted timestamp to retain
    reproducibility.
