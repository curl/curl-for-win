  Verify using:
  ```
  cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub.asc --bundle curl-8.16.0-win64-mingw.zip.sigstore curl-8.16.0-win64-mingw.zip
  ```
- Standalone `curl`, `trurl` tools and `libcurl` DLL. Static libraries
  included.
- Required: Windows Vista with
  [Universal CRT](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-322bf30f-4735-bb94-3949-49f5c49f4732)
  (64-bit ARM or Intel), macOS 10.9 Mavericks (ARM or Intel),
  Linux [kernel](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/supported-platforms) 2.6.39+
  (amd64, arm64, RISC-V 64) with [MUSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl)
  builds.
- [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3),
  [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) support,
  and [more](#features).
- Windows 64-bit builds are
  [Control Flow Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard)
  enabled. Intel builds have
  [CET](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/technical-look-control-flow-enforcement-technology.html)
  enabled. All builds have frame pointers enabled.
- Transparent builds, using open source code, run in
  [public](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/main),
  with auditable [logs](#build-logs).
- [LLVM/Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) build environment with
  [`mingw-w64`](https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/) via
  [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/testing/mingw-w64),
  [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mingw-w64),
  [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
  [`llvm-mingw`](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) for ARM64.
- Windows cross-built and published via
  [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/). Linux built via GHA.
  Using reproducible [container](https://docker.debian.net/) image
  [`debian:testing-slim`](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/tree/dist-amd64/testing/slim)
  via rootless [podman](https://podman.io/). macOS built via GHA.
- Linux and macOS builds are *not* official curl builds.
- We verify components using SHA-256, and PGP where provided.
- We build [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/) binaries,
  producing the same hash given the same input sources and C compiler.
- Patching policy: No local patches. We may apply patches if already merged
  upstream or &mdash; for showstoppers &mdash; had them submitted with fair
  confidence of getting merged.
- You can look up our package hashes in lines starting with `SHA` in the
  [build log](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl-for-win/branch/main).
- Packages built across host platforms do not have identical hashes due to
  slightly different build options and toolchain builds/versions. Except
  `llvm-mingw` builds used for ARM64, which are reproducible across platforms.
- We code-sign with a self-signed certificate on Windows, and avoid trusted
  timestamps for reproducibility.
